# Plater Selective Import

Updating your Player profile can be a tedious task, since if you have made any custom changes to the profile, you'll have to redo them all.

This AddOn allows you to import only the parts of your profile that you want to keep, and then merge them with the current profile.

## How to use

1. Open the AddOn. `/platerselectiveimport`
2. Insert the import string into the `Imported Profile` edit box, and press `Enter`.
3. Select the options you want to import, and click `Merge`.
4. Copy the new profile string from the `New Profile` edit box.
5. Import the profile like you normally would.

## Info

Only certain options are supported currently.

Always keep a backup of your current profile, just in case.
